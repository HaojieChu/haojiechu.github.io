I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Economic Statistics from Zhengzhou University and my Master's degree in Data Science from University Malaya. My interests are centered on the development of advanced machine learning techniques to enhance decision-making processes, particularly within the business sector. I am dedicated to continuous learning and ensuring I remain conversant with the latest advancements in data science, including Large Language Models (LLMs).</p> 

<br> I am actively looking for research opportunities.
