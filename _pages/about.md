<p>I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Economic Statistics from Zhengzhou University and my Master's degree in Data Science from University Malaya. </p>
<br>
<p>My interests are centered on the development of advanced machine learning techniques to enhance decision-making processes in multiple sectors (such as business, healthcare). I am dedicated to continuous learning and ensuring I remain conversant with the latest advancements in data science, including Large Language Models (LLMs) and Explainable AI (XAI).</p>

<b>I am actively looking for research opportunities for 2024 Summer (not anymore...)</b>
